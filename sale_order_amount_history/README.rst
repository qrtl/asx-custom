This module does the following:

* Adds the Sales Order Amount History model (sale.order.amount.history).
* Creates Sales Order Amount History records for certain changes in the sales order.

Changes that create history
---------------------------

Changes that create a Sales Order Amount History record:

* State change from 'Quotation' / 'Quotation Sent' to 'Sales Order' (History Type 'Add')
* State change from 'Sales Order' to 'Canceled' (History Type 'Delete')
* Amount change when sales order is in 'Sales Order' state ('History Type 'Change')

Exception: Sales orders for the group companies (which should be indicated by the
assigned fiscal position) should not create history records.

The design of Order Count
-------------------------

When a history record is created, Order Count is added (+1) when the order amount
changes from zero to something else, and deducted (-1) when the order amount changes
to zero.  Below are the patterns.

* Sales order with non-zero amount is confirmed.  -> 1
* Sales order with zero amount is confirmed.  -> 0
* Amount is changed from non-zero to non-zero for a confirmed sales order.  -> 0
* Amount is changed from zero to non-zero for a confirmed sales order.  -> 1
* Amount is changed from non-zero to zero for a confirmed sales order.  -> -1
* Conirmed sales order with non-zero amount is cancelled.  -> -1
* Conirmed sales order with zero amount is cancelled.  -> 0
