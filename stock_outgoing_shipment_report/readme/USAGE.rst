When a carrier is selected in a sales order or an outgoing shipment, the system proposes
the carrier account number for the partner (delivery address, in case of sales order)
from the carrier account master data.

The input carrier related information in sales order is passed down to the outgoing
shipment.

From the stock picking model, you can follow *Action > Generate Delivery Data* to
generate the outgoing shipment data.

The generated content is expected to be exported using Odoo's data export functionality.
